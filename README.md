# Firebase Adventures

[Firebase Adventures](https://adventures.firebaseapp.com) is a journey about how to use Firebase in different ways to give you the ability to build extraordinary cross-platform apps.

## Running locally

First change the `FirebaseUrl` in `app.js` file and create a Twitter app following the [Firebase documentation](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/twitter.html).
With this in place run the commands bellow:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt serve
```

And that's it!
